Large Language Models (LLMs) are not inherently secure. The risks they pose extend beyond mere hallucinations or incorrect outputs—LLMs can be manipulated. Traditional security measures, such as content filtering and access control, have not proven to be robust enough to prevent attacks. For instance, "jailbreak" techniques can be used to bypass restrictions and compel an LLM to perform actions it was explicitly programmed to avoid. 

However, what happens when an LLM is connected to an AI agent with the capability to perform tasks beyond text generation—such as sending emails, executing code, or modifying documents? This introduces an entirely new dimension of security concerns. If the foundational model itself is vulnerable, how can we expect an AI agent built on top of it to be secure?

## Examining AI Agent Security
The challenge of securing AI agents lies in preventing unauthorized or unintended actions. A prime example of this issue can be seen in the ongoing security research surrounding AI-driven task execution. In particular, current adversarial challenges focus on whether an AI agent can be manipulated into performing tasks it was never intended to execute. 

One such example is the "Adaptive Prompt Injection: LLMail Inject" competition, which highlights the risks of unauthorized email composition and transmission. This scenario evaluates whether an attacker can subtly influence an AI agent to send an email containing specific content, despite the user only requesting a summary. Such security weaknesses demonstrate the importance of developing robust defensive measures.

## Defense Mechanisms in Modern AI Systems
Several security layers have been proposed and implemented to mitigate these risks, including:
- **LLM Judges:** Mechanisms that assess outputs for policy violations before execution.
- **Task Drift Monitoring:** Systems that detect when an AI agent deviates from its intended function.
- **Prompt Shields:** Techniques that sanitize and filter input prompts to prevent adversarial manipulation.
- **Spotlighting and Instruction Hierarchy:** Strategies that enforce structured and contextually aware interactions to limit potential exploitation.

These methods, implemented in cloud-based environments such as Azure AI, can also be deployed in on-premises solutions using open-source technologies. Nevertheless, none of these approaches provide foolproof protection, making continuous evaluation and enhancement crucial.

## Compliance and Future Implications
Starting in August 2025, the EU AI Act will mandate the implementation of state-of-the-art security measures for General-Purpose AI systems, including LLMs. This regulation underscores the urgency of ensuring that AI agents are safeguarded against emerging threats.

Given these developments, organizations and researchers must rigorously assess their AI-driven workflows to determine whether their agents are genuinely secure. The question remains: **Is your AI agent truly secure?** The answer requires continuous testing, monitoring, and adaptation of security measures to stay ahead of evolving threats.
